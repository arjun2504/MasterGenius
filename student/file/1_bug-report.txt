Dear Mark Zuckerberg,

First sorry for breaking your privacy and post to your wall, i has no other choice to make all the reports i sent to Facebook team .

i report that exploit twice , first time i got replay that my link has an error while opening , other replay i got was " sorry this is not a bug " . both reports i sent from
www.facebook.com/whitehat , and as you see iam not in your friend list and yet i can post to your timeline .
